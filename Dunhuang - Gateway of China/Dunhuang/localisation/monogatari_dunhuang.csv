dunhuang.intro.charlemagne;In the heyday of the Tang Dynasty, the flourishing cities of Gansu like Dunhuang, Jiuquan, and Anxi served as the gateway to the Silk Road.

However, recent events threaten the stability and prosperity of this region.\n\nThough the An Lushan rebellion in China was crushed years ago, generals and governors turned warlords run rampant across the declining Tang Empire. Furthermore, Tang control is slipping away in frontier regions, and the Tibetan Empire may take advantage of the tenuous situation to conquer wealthy cities like Dunhuang.

dunhuang.16.desc.a;The Zhang family have been one of several elite families in Dunhuang for generations. Only heaven knows why the world is in chaos. In light of recent events, some say the Tang are losing the mandate of heaven, and may never recover. The Tibetans have taken advantage of this situation, and have already seized control of several prefectures. Within a couple decades, they may very well control all of Dunhuang.\n\nGiven our family's abilities as administrators, the Tibetans appointed us as officials in the region. Yet their trust in us is an opportunity. There has already been talk of rebellion against Tibet, but we and other, more level-headed clans, such as the Caos, know that the Tibetans are strong, so we must bide our time. No matter how many generations it takes, we will throw off the yoke of Tibetan rule one day!;;;;;;;;;;;x

Yet all is not calm.\n\nWe are no fools, and know we face dangers from all sides. Though we are not brutish and power-hungry like the other generals and governors, the declining Tang Dynasty's leadership does not trust us. Meanwhile, Turkic nomads covet our lands. Most dangerously of all, perhaps, are Dunhuang's scheming noble families, who have motives of their own. We must be strong and united if Dunhuang is to grow and prosper, but under our family's rule, we have no doubt that great things can be achieved.;;;;;;;;;;;x

When Zhang Yichao drove out the Tibetans years ago, we were among his most reliable followers, but we fear what will happen after he dies, as his heirs are unworthy.

To us, however, his blood runs in our veins, and so he is our revered ancestor.\n\nIt took years, but we now rule Dunhuang. Zhang Yichao, who overthrew the Tibetan oppressors, was admirable, but his successors were weak, unable to control the scheming noble clans. Thus, we had to step in to restore order. Let others call us tyrants! Cao Cao was called the same despite his noble ambitions.

After all, our illustrious ancestors include calligraphers, astrologers, teachers, and scholars. Out here in the outpost of civilization, only knowledge and wisdom will keep us alive. In this era when death and destruction roam the land once more, we must be vigilant and foster our intellectual and spiritual growth, lest we fall to barbarism.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.18.a;The Suo family shall endure as it always has!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.19.tooltip; \n\nThe Lis have many branches, including that of the Tang Emperors. The branch in Dunhuang is proud of their aristocratic pedigree, though some claim their connection to the other Lis is imaginary and made up.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.19.title;Of the August Lineage;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.19.desc;Other noble families in Dunhuang look upon us with envy, and not without good reason: we are the great Li, a clan whose achievements are unmatched and resound through the centuries. Our ancestors include the revered philosopher Laozi and the general Li Guang of the Han Dynasty, and we count the Emperors of the Tang Dynasty as our distant cousins. The other families pale in comparison to our glory.\n\nThough Dunhuang is but an outpost of true civilization, it is an important one nevertheless, and we take our role as an integral part of this community seriously as we always had for generations. Now, when the world is in chaos, and warlords and barbarians lurk around every corner, we must be ever more careful and vigilant if we are to protect our own legacy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.19.a;The Li are the supreme clan of Dunhuang!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.20.tooltip; \n\nThe Zhais were middling officials for many years, and only recently have they been propelled to the realm of Dunhuang's elites. They will have to prove themselves worthy of such prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.20.title;The Patient Learners;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.20.desc;While the great houses of Dunhuang schemed against one another, we, the Zhai family, have built for ourselves a solid foundation. Let the snobbish aristocrats sneer at us! Our current patriarch, Zhai Fengda, began his career as a lowly clerk, just like his father. Now he is not only a respected official, but one of the preeminent scholars of this generation, specializing in calendars and astronomy.\n\nThe other noble families see us as noveau riche upstarts, who only recently gained power and wealth, even though ironically we have been high-ranking officials for many generations, and even have a couple of caves in Mogao. Unlike them, it simply took us longer to accumulate vast wealth and status. No matter what, through our hard work and faith, we can achieve great things in a place like Dunhuang.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.20.a;The Zhai shall rise to great heights!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.21.tooltip; \n\nThe Yins are one of Dunhuang's older clans and known for their caution when it comes to risky intrigue and ventures, which they learned bitterly from experience. They are a wealthy family and have many connections with the Western foreigners.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.21.title;The Cautious Merchants;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.21.desc;We are the ancient Yin family, who have been here for many centuries, and we are proud of such a pedigree. Our illustrious forebear, Yin Dan, fled here in the days of the Jin Dynasty, due to his relatives' unrestrained ambition that nearly annihilated our clan. We know how petty power struggles can ruin the prosperity and influence accumulated from generations of work. Instead, we have focused on trade and making connections with foreign peoples.\n\nIt does not matter who rules this land - whether a Tang Emperor, Tibetan king, Turkic Khan, or Chinese warlord - as long as peace and stability can be maintained, we and the region shall prosper and grow.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.21.a;The Yin shall persevere, even in this age of chaos!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dunhuang.30.desc;Once more, the eastern end of the Silk Road - the gateway to the West, as it were - is home to a powerful, independent kingdom, thanks in part to your leadership and hard work. Centered around the great frontier towns of Dunhuang and Jiuquan that have stood as trade entrepots and an outpost of civilization for centuries, it will surely prosper.\n\nOne question remains: what shall we name this kingdom? In the past, various regimes have called this the Kingdom of Liang, after the old Chinese province of Liang in the region, but there are other names your advisors say you should consider as well.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.30.a;Kingdom of Liang;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.30.b;Kingdom of Jinshan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIET_dunhuang_founded_text_liang_not_li;Let us stick with tradition, and emulate our predecessors here who called their realm Liang, for it was the name for the region since the days of the glorious Han Dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_dunhuang_founded_text_jinshan;Jinshan, the Golden Mountain - it is a poetic name, and fitting for our state. We shall be prosperous and we shall be firm and unyielding.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_dunhuang_founded_text_dunhuang;Though there are a few major cities in the region, Dunhuang stands above the rest as a center of trade and religion. Our kingdom should be named after it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_dunhuang_founded_text_guiyi;Guiyi is the name of the army that fought against Tibetan rule, meaning the Return to Righteousness Army. It is a fitting name for our state.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.31.title;[From.PrimaryTitle.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.31.desc;Generations ago, during the tumultuous period of China's history known as the Sixteen Kingdoms and the Northern and Southern Dynasties, the Gansu region was home to several kingdoms. Now, under the leadership of [From.GetTitle] [From.GetDynName], the descendants of these kingdoms' old rulers, whether in blood or in spirit, have once again forged a powerful, independent state centered around the great cities of the region like Dunhuang and Jiuquan. It is called the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName].\n\nWith prosperity from the Silk Road trade, powerful armies, and the Middle Kingdom's sense of culture and refinement, their achievements will surely go down in history.;;;;;;;;;;;x

dunhuang.50.title;Mogao Caves;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.50.desc;The Mogao Caves have stood for centuries as a testament to the truth of the Dharma as taught by Lord Buddha. Now, I have an opportunity to gain some merit by sponsoring the construction of a new cave. I have found a promising artist who has the experience I need to oversee and manage the sort of work involved with making a new cave at Mogao.\n\nAfter some discussion regarding the logistics of the whole endeavor, we get down to business, discussing what I want for the cave itself. In other words, what will my cave's art will focus on?;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.50.a;Showing my and my family's devotion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.50.b;Retelling Buddhist fables and parables;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.50.c;Visions of enlightened beings and deities;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_dunhuang_caves_focus_family_text;The world must know of the nobility and righteousness of my lineage and my kin, and how we have contributed much to the flowering of the true way.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_dunhuang_caves_focus_jataka_text;The Jataka Tales have entertained people for generations, and are still popular - they are a great way to teach everyone right conduct and attitudes.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_dunhuang_caves_focus_deities_text;What better than to directly honor the Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and other deities than to focus on them? Let those who see my cave be inspired!;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.51.desc;The second and more important matter, of course, is the cost. It will depend on how big I want the cave to be and the level of detail and quality I am expecting. I have already set aside some funds for my cave, but if I want something bigger and grander, I will likely have to spend more. Am I willing to pay extra money?;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.51.a;Some, but not too much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.51.b;A lot - this cave will be amazing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.51.c;On second thought, no.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.52.desc;Now that negotiations are done, all I can do now is wait until the caves are finished. ;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.52.a;What a sight they will be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.53.desc;Finally, after a long wait, the men I commissioned are finished carving out a new cave in the Mogao Caves. It is beautiful and stunning, just as I imagined, and the pictures carved on the murals look so realistic. This cave will proudly stand alongside the rest of the grottoes here for many more centuries, a testament to the holiness and strength of the Three Jewels.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.53.a;A job well done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Such is the cycle of life and rebirth! Still, while they are no longer here to see this come to fruition, their good deed will earn them much merit in future lives, merit which is surely also shared with the rest of the family as well!;;;;;;;;;;;x

dunhuang.60.desc;While working on the Mogao Cave I commissioned, one of the workmen had a dream one night where he was visited by an unknown Bodhisattva. This can be considered an auspicious sign.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.60.a;Very good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.61.desc;Calamity struck while my men were working on the Mogao Cave. A small sandstorm swept through the area, and though it did not damage much or cause any loss of life, it did destroy some progress on my cave.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.61.a;Unfortunate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.62.desc;The caravans transporting goods and materials used in my Mogao Cave were attacked by nomad bandits. Though we did not lose all of it, this is a blow to the project. Surely those vile men will be reborn in the hell realm in the next life for their evil acts against the Three Jewels!;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.62.a;Still, I will have to make up for those losses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.63.desc;One of the local Buddhist lay organizations in Dunhuang has heard about my project to expand the Mogao Caves with my own. They are impressed and offer some funds to help. All they ask is for a little recognition.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.63.a;They shall be depicted in the cave's murals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.63.b;I will give them donations instead as thanks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.63.c;I don't need their support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.64.desc;A prominent monk from one of Dunhuang's monasteries is visiting the construction site today at the Mogao Caves. He had good things to say about what was being done, so I am relieved.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.64.a;I gave him some alms before he left.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.65.desc;There have been some delays with my cave at Mogao. By coincidence, my cave is being carved next to another cave under construction, which is being sponsored by an association of merchants. There have been some clashes as to the boundaries between our caves. Though the legal authorities have ruled in my favor, the merchants still seem upset.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.65.a;I'll back off. We should not fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.65.b;Pay the merchants to back down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.65.c;Forget the merchants! This is my cave!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.65.d;Why don't we combine our efforts?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.66.tooltip;Surely with one massive cave, together we can both honor the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha even more so than if we worked separately!;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.66.desc;The merchants were surprised by my gesture, and accepted. We all forgave each other for our transgressions, and laughed at how silly our squabble was. The Buddha taught us to not be misled by our afflictive emotions after all, as this causes negative karma. A good thing came out of this thankfully, and the cave will be even bigger and greater than before!;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.66.a;A happy ending.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.67.desc;After spending some time with the merchant association to sort out the details of our new combined cave, one of them offered his services to me at my court. He is talented and we had gotten along really well, so I would love to have him around to help me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.67.a;Yes, welcome, my Dharma brother!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.68.desc;While working on my Mogao Cave, the workers found a hidden room, leading them to a sealed cave that had been lost for centuries! It is filled with priceless scrolls and other spiritual artifacts.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.68.a;Donate the items to one of the local monasteries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.68.b;Those artifacts would go nicely in my cave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.68.c;I want to bring these back home to study.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.68.d;Selling these should net me a nice profit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.69.desc;One of the main artisans in charge of this whole cave project is a foreigner from afar. He is competent and brings a unique foreign influence to his art. That said, though he fluent in our language and customs, he is still awkward at times and has difficulty communicating with the others at times.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.69.a;As long as he does his job, it is no matter to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.69.b;I'll help him if there are any misunderstandings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.70.desc;The artisan was grateful for my assistance, and, furthermore, tells me that my graciousness has convinced him to stay permanently here after the project is done. Who knows what other things he can help me with?;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.70.a;Very good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.71.desc;Today I inspected the site of my Mogao Cave project. The workers seem to be doing their job well, all except for one, who works slower than everyone else. The others say he is tired and recently got sick and that he is usually a good worker.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.71.a;Fire him! He's obviously pretending.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.71.b;Let's hope he gets better. Carry on, then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.71.c;I will personally make sure he is given medicine and care.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.72.desc;A group of monks from one of the local monasteries near Dunhuang have come to perform some religious ceremonies, chantings and prayers, at my Mogao Cave under construction. Though they often don't ask for it explicitly, it is customary to offer them something afterwards as a sign of appreciation, and for good merit.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.72.a;Why should I? Monks are so greedy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.72.b;Of course. Here are some donations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.72.c;A large donation is what they need!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.73.desc;For those who follow the teachings of the Buddha, eating vegetarian food every now and then is a sure way to show our faith, and to gain merit. When you travel to the site of your cave's construction one day, it appears that the workers and everyone involved have organized a vegetarian feast in honor of your visit.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.73.a;I hate vegetarian food. I will merely observe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.73.b;I will eat what I need to, nothing more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIET_recently_went_to_nadun_festival;Recently Attended Nadun Festival;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.130.desc;I have decided to attend the Nandun festival this year. It is the harvest festival of the Tuyuhun, or Tu peoples, and it will surely be lots of fun! Traditionally, it lasts for around two months, and requires cooperation between many different villages and clans in the area.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.130.a;I can't wait.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.131.tooltip;It will only be a matter of time....;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.131.title;Nadun;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.131.desc;The Nadun festival is starting! I have arrived with my entourage at the host village where this year's Nadun will be held. Sedan chairs and tents have been set up for the comfortable transport and lodgings of various heavenly beings. Sacrificial offerings have been set up, and men from other villages begin to march to the fields belonging to the host village. Bearing colorful banners inscribed with auspicious sayings and blessings, and vibrant drums and gongs, these men make loud noise and music, heralding the start of the Nadun festivities.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.131.a;Wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.132.tooltip;Let the fun start!;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.132.desc;At long last, the Nadun festivities have come to a close. I had a great time with the locals, and I hope to attend another one in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.132.a;Until next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.133.desc;As part of the Nadun festival, good news is chanted to the rhythm of the drum beats, so that everyone - even those in heaven - may learn of what fortunes and joys have happened recently.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.133.a;I, too, share with everyone any good news from my family!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.133.b;I observe and listen to what others have to say first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.134.desc;During the Nadun, many dances are performed. Today, a dance has been performed in honor of the heavens. It is an invitation to those in heaven to come down and join in on the excitement.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.134.a;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.135.desc;Right before the Nadun, a special sacrificial cake called Supan was prepared as offerings to the gods. Now that Nadun is fully under way, and the heavenly beings have come down (supposedly), we can enjoy these cakes as well.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.135.a;I will eat a fair amount.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.135.b;I will eat a lot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.135.c;I will restrain from eating too much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.136.desc;During the Nadun, it is customary to toast those involved in the major dances with big bowls. Today, during one of the dances, everyone is toasting the dancers, and the whole atmosphere is lively and fun.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.136.a;I'll stay back to watch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.136.b;I will toast them as well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.137.desc;Theatrical performances have always played a role in Nadun. Most popular is the performance of a story detailing the struggle of a farming family. At the end, the farmer's son accepts his position as a farmer, showing how the continuity of farming from generation to generation is important.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.137.a;After all, where would we be without our food?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.138.desc;Though the people celebrating the Nadun aren't Han Chinese, they take influence from their Chinese neighbors, and theatrical performances of Chinese legends is common. Most popular are stories from the Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history, that era of civil war where heroes and villains fought - both by strength and by wits - to determine the fate of the world. Of these heroes and villains, who do you find most entertaining?;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.138.a;Benevolent Liu Bei, and his stalwart Shu Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.138.b;Ambitious Cao Cao, and his prosperous Wei Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.138.c;Clever Sun Quan, and his brave Wu Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.138.d;Cunning Sima Yi, whose victorious descendants established Jin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.139.desc;Nadun is an important time for people to visit others and share what knowledge and experiences they had throughout the year. In the host village, I have a number of acquaintances I could visit - shall I enjoy their company?;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.139.a;No, I am enjoying the festival as is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.139.b;Yes, that sounds like a good idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.139.c;I want to meet new friends instead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.140.desc;Because I am a high ranking guest in the host village during Nadun, I am offered a high seat at the feast table, and provided the best foods these peasants can afford to make. It is simple and hardy fare, such as noodles in butter with beef, tea with milk, and fried buns.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.140.a;I am most thankful! Simple food has its appeal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.140.b;I eat better at home, but I don't mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.140.c;This food tastes very plain and bland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.141.desc;At the Nadun, besides the dancing, there is also much singing of many traditional songs. It is wonderful to hear all the melodies around!;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.141.a;A delight for the soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.142.desc;For young people, Nadun is often when love begins to blossom, as it is a time of merrymaking and socialization. I have observed many young men and women from the village awkwardly but surely making their first steps towards love and perhaps, one day, if their parents are willing, marriage.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.142.a;Ah, young love! It is so wonderful to see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.142.b;Bah, they'll become bitter and jaded with time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

I look to him as an exemplar, for few could match his daring, his cunning, his brilliance, and above all, his ambition. The entire world, including Dunhuang, is going through a turbulent era just like that of the Three Kingdoms. And so, like him, I will make my mark on the world in this age of chaos!;;;;;;;;;;;x

dunhuang.151.desc;Cao Yijin, who hails from the Cao clan of Dunhuang's nobility, has recently come of age. Many elites - even those in neighboring realms - have kept an eye on him ever since he was a young child, for he possessed a fire within him unlike any other. He is intelligent, capable, ambitious, and has already become an official in the local administration.\n\nThen again, in his veins runs the blood of Cao Cao, the mighty warlord and prime minister of the Han Dynasty, after all. Few could match Cao Cao's daring, cunning, brilliance, and ambition. In these turbulent times, could Cao Yijin be another Cao Cao, and bring order to what is chaos?;;;;;;;;;;;x

dunhuang.153.desc;I have been a highly respected member of Dunhuang's elite and administration for many years, and it is clear why. The westernmost corner of Chinese civilization is in chaos, led by inept rulers and overrun by covetous barbarians who seek to take advantage of the decline of the Tang Dynasty, and I am one of the few truly capable leaders here.\n\nCenturies ago, through his ambition and talents, my august ancestor Cao Cao brought order to a world turn asunder by chaos. Though I dare not compare my lacking, inferior self to Cao Cao, I must emulate him if I am to bring order to chaos in this part of the world. I will become ruler of all Dunhuang one day, but must plan carefully and intelligently if I am to realize my ambitions.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.153.a;May my ancestors be proud of me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.154.title;Cao Yijin's Ambition;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.154.desc;Times are turbulent, even in Dunhuang, the outpost of Chinese civilization in the west. After Tibetan rule was overthrown not too long ago, there is rising unrest and discontent in Dunhuang among both the elites and commoners, who are increasingly at odds with the ruling classes.\n\nRising to prominence is a certain Cao Yijin, a capable and popular official who claims descent from the ruthless but brilliant Cao Cao of Three Kingdoms fame. Like his ancestor he is ambitious and seeks to bring order to chaos. Whatever happens, one thing is for sure: his power and ambition will likely influence events in the region for years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;x

dunhuang.160.desc;Zhang Yichao's heroic leadership will be remembered for generations. As a true upholder of Chinese civilization, he led the people of the Guiyi Circuit to overthrow the barbaric Tibetan tyrants. With his passing, however, there is a power vacuum in the Dunhuang region.\n\nMany are skeptical about his successors. There are rumors that some elite Dunhuang clans are plotting to seize control of the region themselves, while unrest is growing by the day among the commoners without a charismatic leader to guide them. Will the region succumb to lawlessness and disorder, or will another great leader like Zhang Yichao step forward onto the stage of world history?;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.160.a;What will happen now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.161.title;A Game of Clans;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.161.desc.a;Our great patriarch Zhang Yichao has sadly left this world for the next. Many elite clans have come to pay their respects to him, but we who are his successors know better - behind their false tears and words of comfort are scheming hearts and conniving minds. Times are tumultuous, and they think without Zhang Yichao, we are unable to properly rule Dunhuang.\n\nWe must prepare ourselves lest the other clans get too audacious and make their bids to wrestle control of Dunhuang from us. Zhang Yichao worked hard to restore Dunhuang's honor - it is our duty to make sure his sacrifices were not in vain. Guide us, Zhang Yichao, and we shall not falter!;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.161.desc.b;Like many elites in Dunhuang, we came to pay our respects to the deceased Zhang Yichao as soon as we heard of his passing. Now, however, times are tumultuous, and Dunhuang is growing increasingly unstable without a strong and admirable leader.\n\nThe other clans in Dunhuang are aware of our ambitions - it is in our blood. But we are the Caos, the most prestiguous of the clans of Dunhuang after the Zhang. Let the others scheme like little children. We will be the ones to bring order to chaos in the end. Our ambitions will be realized!;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.161.desc.c;Like many elites in Dunhuang, we came to pay our respects to the deceased Zhang Yichao as soon as we heard of his passing. Now, however, times are tumultuous, and Dunhuang is growing increasingly unstable without a strong and admirable leader.\n\nWe are the Li family, who are descended from the great sage Laozi and the mighty general Li Guang, and who are distant cousins of the Tang Emperors. It is our duty, as the most venerable of the Dunhuang clans, to step in to restore order if this region falls to chaos. We will bow to no inferior upstarts if they prove themselves unworthy!;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.161.desc.d;Like many elites in Dunhuang, we came to pay our respects to the deceased Zhang Yichao as soon as we heard of his passing. Now, however, times are tumultuous, and Dunhuang is growing increasingly unstable without a strong and admirable leader.\n\nFor generations, the Yin clan has been cautious when it came to political affairs. We stayed out of trouble and focused on building our wealth and connections with foreign lands. Sometimes, however, being aggressive is the safest option. We are confident our prudence and acumen are what this region needs if things go awry. And so, we wait patiently. If we need to act, we will.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.161.desc.e;Like many elites in Dunhuang, we came to pay our respects to the deceased Zhang Yichao as soon as we heard of his passing.

There is no one else who deserves to rule Dunhuang more than us. Imbeciles currently control this land - a more intellectual and refined clan such as ourselves is what this region deserves. Without proper care, how can a seed blossom into a beautiful tree?;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.161.desc.f;Like many elites in Dunhuang, we came to pay our respects to the deceased Zhang Yichao as soon as we heard of his passing.

Control of Dunhuang is surely within our grasp if we are wise, patient, and decisive. This is an age of opportunity and danger, but our mighty clan will go down in the history books one day for certain!;;;;;;;;;;;x

dunhuang.202.desc;I pass by a ruined section of the ancient Great Wall in Gansu. The walls, ramparts, and keep were once impressive sights many centuries ago, when soldiers of one of the earlier Chinese dynasties were stationed here. Now, nothing remains but weathered stone, dust, and sand.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.202.a;This is a reminder of the impermanence of all things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.202.b;What a glorious place this must have been!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.203.desc;Today you decided to pay a visit to the nearby singing sand dunes of Dunhuang. Since time immemorial, locals have traveled here to admire the singing or drumming sound these sand dunes make when wind blows against them. Some even say this miracle of nature is a gift from heaven.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.203.a;A splendid experience!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.204.desc;A number of foreign artists living in the Dunhuang region banded together to present to you some works of art, as a sign of their support for you. The sculptures, paintings, and scrolls they present to you utilize a blend of styles, including Indian, Chinese, Iranian, and Tibetan art.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.204.a;It is a wonderful gift!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.205.desc;A renowned, elderly Buddhist nun living in Dunhuang recently passed away. She was your acquaintance, and interestingly enough, in her will she left some of her worldly possessions to you, like silk robes or religious scrolls. Her family wants to dispute this and bring it to the legal authorities, however. Though they will likely side with you, this situation could get messy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.205.a;Those things are mine! I refuse to go to court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.205.b;They can have those things. I have no need for them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.205.c;We will take this to the courts to be settled honorably.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.205.d;I'm not Buddhist - I don't want those heathen items!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.206.desc;An elderly monk living in one of Dunhuang's monasteries recently passed away. He had some valuable possessions, but his will was unclear, so his relatives are fighting over the possessions. This is a common situation in Dunhuang, given how many Buddhist monasteries are here, but as this monk is from a renowned clan, we should intervene to restore order given his relatives are powerful themselves and could cause a great disturbance in the community if they fight.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.206.a;I side with the nephew.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.206.b;I side with the niece.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.206.c;This belongs to the state, actually.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.206.d;I should not intervene.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.207.desc;Recently, in the Dunhuang region, there has been a trend of people who are Buddhist monks and nuns on paper, but live normal lives with normal jobs and families in practice. It is clear that many people are doing this as a form of tax evasion, as clergy are not taxed. However, we have always been reluctant to do anything lest we anger the religious authorities.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.207.a;Ignore their excuses! Enforce the law and fine the violators!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.207.b;Let them be - why do I care? It's not a big deal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.208.desc;I received a gift of juicy Dunhuang melons today. Melons from Dunhuang are very famous for their quality and flavor, and are enjoyed by everyone.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.208.a;Thank you very much!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.209.desc;Interesting news from the Mogao caves of Dunhuang! A hidden, sealed off cave was discovered right next to a cave belonging to a monastery under your jurisdiction. Though it is mostly empty of valuables, it contains a number of beautiful rooms decorated with various paintings and artwork.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.209.a;We can restore it to its former glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.209.b;That is fascinating news indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.210.desc;Today I am paying a visit to Crescent Lake, a notable body of water by the deserts of Dunhuang. It is a popular place for people to visit in their free time, where they can see the gorgeous lake and the surrounding pristine, desert landscape.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.210.a;It is really beautiful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.211.desc;Two men appear before you to resolve their dispute. The Sogdian merchant claims the Khotanese monk did not pay in full for his purchase. The Khotanese monk claims the Sogdian cheated him. Who is in the right?;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.211.a;The Sogdian merchant made better arguments;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.211.b;The Khotanese monk is clearly in the right;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.211.c;This is none of my concern;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.211.d;Actually, this was merely a misunderstanding, as...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.212.desc;You have recently begun to take some rhubarb, a vegetable known to help with maintaining a good digestive system. It was first grown in Jiuquan, not too far from Dunhuang, and the rhubarb from Jiuquan is still of the highest quality.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.212.a;It is good I own land not too far from the main rhubarb farms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.213.desc;A large cave in the Mogao grottoes close to Dunhuang has recently finished with its carving and decorating. It was a joint effort of several monasteries and organizations of lay Buddhists, and boasts several large clay statues of various Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. When I came to inspect the cave myself, I have to admit it was impressive.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.213.a;Not as impressive as my family's caves of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.213.b;Hopefully good things will come from this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.213.c;The patrons should congratulate themselves for a magnificent result!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.214.desc;While visiting one of the Mogao caves near Dunhuang, I come across a large and imposing figure of a reclining Buddha. With its colors and size, it is most impressive and amazing.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.214.a;How did they carve such a thing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.215.desc;Today I am visiting a Mogao grotto near Dunhuang. It was built for a famous nobleman who lived many generations ago. In the cave is a small stelae detailing his life and accomplishments, and why he wanted to dedicate this cave.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.215.a;Will I too, one day, be a forgotten memory like this man?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.215.b;His cave is certainly very impressive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.215.c;That stelae is just full of self-important boasting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.216.desc;A foreign artisan recently settled in Dunhuang. He has made a name for himself, creating art that combines the styles of his native land with the Buddhist Chinese, Tibetan, and nomad influences common in Dunhuang. Many are flocking to patronize him.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.216.a;I could sponsor him to make some artwork to decorate my house.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.216.b;That is nice to hear, but why should I care?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.217.desc;Given how the Silk Road runs through Dunhuang, in the Gansu region, silk is oftentimes a common method of payment. A family dispute within a prominent clan recently happened under your jurisdiction, which led to a number of disturbances and threats to public order. As a result, the family had to pay you a fine for causing such a ruckus.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.217.a;Thank you for the silk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.218.desc;A local Dunhuang nobleman I am acquainted with miscalculated his finances and is spiraling into debt. Even though he's sold off all of his silk, the main form of currency in the Gansu region of the Silk Road, he is still hemorrhaging money. All he has is a pretty female slave, but he is reluctant to give her up as he is very attached to her. He comes to me for advice and help.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.218.a;You need to sell that slave, or else you'll go bankrupt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.218.b;I'll lend you some money, friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.218.c;I'm interested in the girl. I'll pay more for her than the merchants!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.219.desc;Thank goodness! A couple of specialists recently arrived from China to help us maintain the irrigation canals in Dunhuang. Dunhuang's canals are often old and in need of repairs.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.219.a;Their expertise is greatly appreciated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.220.desc;A powerful merchant who is a leader in the local Sogdian community visited me today. We concluded a number of business deals that would benefit both of us greatly. The Sogdians are infamous for their acumen and business know-how, and there are many living in my realm around Dunhuang, so this should be a good thing.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.220.a;Good, good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.221.desc;One of the more erudite and cultured monks from a monastery at Dunhuang that I have connections with has dedicated a lovely poem to me. I read it on the manuscript of paper he wrote it on, and am deeply moved.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.221.a;Very good! Very good poetry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.222.desc;Iranian and Tocharian slave women are popular in the Dunhuang region among wealthier men, especially those from the far east. [target_dunhuang_horny_character.GetTitledName] has recently wasted significant sums of money to buy several beauties for his household, ostensibly as he needs more servants. Ha! Everyone knows he wants to keep his own little harem of exotic beauties to play with. He even married one.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.222.a;[target_dunhuang_horny_character.GetTitledName] is a lascivious fellow, we all know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.223.desc;As a descendant of the great Cao Cao, how can I ever match his stunning successes and brilliant and cunning mind? Am I making him proud, or does he look down on me from the heavens or wherever he is? I must work harder to realize my ambitions, just as he did!;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.223.a;The glory of the Cao clan shall live on for generations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.224.desc;In the days of old, at the beginning of the Three Kingdoms era of Chinese history, our august ancestor Cao Cao faced many enemies when the Middle Kingdom was thrown into chaos. Yet he held steady, overcame all challenges, and achieved great things. Recently, I've been thinking about the stories surrounding him, specifically...;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.224.a;That time he said his most famous quote about betrayal....;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.224.b;Oh! All the marvelous poetry he wrote, which are still recited now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.224.c;His devastating defeat at the Battle of Red Cliffs - truly a dark day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.224.d;His bizarre fascination with married women and sleeping with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_dunhuang_cao_cao_thoughts_betrayal_quote; \n\n"I rather betray others than have others betray me," so the saying goes. Such a misunderstood phrase, yet one full of penetrating insight!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_dunhuang_cao_cao_thoughts_great_poetry; \n\nThere is one poem I enjoy in particular - the one he wrote before the Battle of Red Cliffs:\n\n"I lift my drink and sing a song, for who knows if one's life is short or long?\nMan's life is like the morning dew, past days many future days few.\nThe melancholy my heart begets comes from cares I cannot forget.\nWho can unravel these sorrows of mine? I know of only one man, the God of Wine.";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_dunhuang_cao_cao_thoughts_red_cliffs; \n\nHe was overconfident and was defeated by a coalition of skilled generals under the warlords Sun Quan and Liu Bei. Nevertheless, our august ancestor learned much from this bitter lesson, and it made him an even wiser man.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_dunhuang_cao_cao_thoughts_MILF_fetish; \n\nThere are those who say this is merely slander against our great ancestor, who treated his wives and concubines with unprecedented respect. Others say he was exactly this, a man with a great appetite for women. Who knows what the truth is?;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.225.desc;There are those who doubt my family lineage. Let them think what they think! We and our cousins the Tang Emperors descend from one of the greatest lineages of all Chinese history. In our blood flows the wisdom of the great Laozi and the tiger-like courage of the Han Dynasty general Li Guang.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.225.a;I am proud of my ancestors, and I hope they are proud of me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.226.desc;Today the caravan of a powerful Sogdian merchant has arrived in my domain, carrying all manner of commodities from all corners of the silk road. His caravan will do business in our domains for a number of weeks, before moving on.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.226.a;His business is most welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.227.desc;Today, I paid a visit to the White Horse Pagoda In the center of Dunhuang. It was built centuries ago by the Buddhist monk Kumarajiva, who despite royal Indian and Kuchean ancestry, devoted his life to translating Buddhist texts into Chinese. The pagoda commemorates his loyal horse, Tianliu, who passed away in Dunhuang during one of Kumarajiva's journeys.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.227.a;How remarkable that this monument still stands today!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.227.b;Though I'm of a different faith, the horse's devotion is inspiring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.227.c;It's nice, I suppose, but I don't think it's that special.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.228.desc;You were returning home from a short trip within your territories in Dunhuang when you passed by the famed Mogao Caves. You witnessed a few people praying at one of the Buddhist shrines there. After they finished, you asked what they were doing, and they said they are a caravan of pilgrims and merchants, praying to the enlightened beings for protection on their upcoming journey.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.228.a;Ah! I see. Best of luck to you, then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.228.b;Prayer isn't enough. You need diligence and cunning, too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.229.desc;A troupe of acrobats and dancers are visiting from China today. Though we are on the frontier of civilization as far as the inhabitants of the Middle Kingdom are concerned, we still maintain commercial and cultural ties with them. The troupe provided my court and I much amusement, and afterwards I gave them gifts of fine silk, spices, and more for their performance.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.229.a;A most impressive troupe!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.230.desc;Music from Kuchea is especially popular around the Dunhuang region. Tonight, I make my way to the streets, and watch several acts by a number of traveling performers from the other parts of the Tarim Basin. The music is sublime, the dancers pleasing in their movements, and the atmosphere a lively one.;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.230.a;What good fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.231.desc;A caravan of important envoys from a foreign kingdom is passing by our territories in Dunhuang, for this region is the last major stop before they entire their ultimate destination: the [offmap_china.GetName] in China. Given this delegation is quite prominent, and no ordinary caravan, your advisors suggest you welcome them warmly - it wouldn't hurt to make some good connections, yes?;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.231.a;Throw a feast for them and give them supplies for the road.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dunhuang.231.b;Letting foreigners pass through our land is courtesy enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
