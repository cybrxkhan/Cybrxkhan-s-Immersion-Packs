# DUNHUANG: Gateway of China

For those in China, Dunhuang was the furthest edge of the civilized world; for outsiders coming from the West by land, it was the final major stop before they entered the Middle Kingdom. This gateway of the Silk Road stood proud for centuries, a trade entrepot and melting pot of Eurasia, as well as a religious center home to the great Buddha Grottoes of Mogao. In the early medieval period, under the leadership of first the Zhang and then the Cao families, Dunhuang enjoyed a degree of independence and power it would never see again… but maybe you can alter the course of history.

In this Immersion Pack, step back to the heyday of the Silk Road to take reins of China's great frontier city. Interact with the multicultural inhabitants of this region, and enshrine your name for posterity by contributing to the ever expanding network of caves in Mogao. Lead one of several elite Chinese families with noble lineages stretching back centuries, such as the Cao who claimed descent from Cao Cao of Three Kingdoms fame, or the Li who claimed descent from Laozi and a distant relation with the Tang Emperors. Whether as Chinese gentry, nomad Khans, or Tuyuhun tribal chieftains, there is adventure to be had in this frontier of East and West!

## SOURCES AND FURTHER READING

The below is NOT a comprehensive list of all the sources I've used, but should cover a significant amount of the reading I did for this Immersion Pack. I also used Wikipedia (including English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese language Wikipedia) where needed, though I did so with discretion and caution.

Of all the sources, the one I recommend the most would be Susan Whitfield's [Life Along the Silk Road, Second Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Life-along-Silk-Road-Second/dp/0520280598)). It is a fairly accessible and entertaining text for laymen and specialists alike, and takes a more "first person" POV of life along the Silk Road, including one chapter dedicated to the Dunhuang official Zhai Fengda, who is playable at the 936 CE startdate in this mod.
