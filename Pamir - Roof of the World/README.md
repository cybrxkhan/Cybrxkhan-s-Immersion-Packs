# PAMIR: The Roof of the World

The Pamir Mountains are a land of pristine blue skies, valleys of endless grass, and rugged, ancient mountains. At the crossroads of the Silk Road, this obscure region has been criss-crossed by travelers, pilgrims, nomads, and conquering armies. The withdrawal of Tang Chinese troops to the East, and the rise of Islam to the West, and Tibet’s tenuous hegemony over the Himalayas, is a recipe for great conflict and change in this region at the dawn of the medieval age.

In this Immersion Pack, travel to the snow-capped peaks and green valleys of the Pamir Plateau. Develop this most remote region with the help from its rugged clans. Invest in the famed lapis lazuli mines of Sar-i Sang or the gold mines of Gilgit, rebuild the ancient watchtowers of the Pamir Plateau, and celebrate the passing of the seasons with the Chinir Festival. Whether they are Pamiri, Kashmiri, Burusho, or others, choose your allies and foes carefully at this crossroads of the Silk Road as you establish your impenetrable fortress at the Roof of the World.

This will be my last mod release for CK2 before I switch to CK3, ending a pretty fun 8 year period of my life. It started with adding changing the appearance of Cumans and Pechenegs to Mongols, and adding a few new traits; somehow I feel like it's fitting for me to end with the Pamir Mountains, an obscure setting that not too many people will care about, but one important to history and full of wonders nevertheless. Thank you all for your support and encouragement over the years, and hope to see you in CK3!

## SOURCES AND FURTHER READING

For this project, I used a variety of sources from online in my research, both scholarly and layman sources. The mod, while not 100% accurate (and probably leans too heavily on using sources for more recent "traditional" culture rather than as it really was in medieval times), should I hope as a result of my research feel authentic and immersive. Anyways, I have listed my sources below for those who would like to learn more about this fascinating region, and its history and culture.
