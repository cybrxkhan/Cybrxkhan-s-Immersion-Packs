The Pamir Mountains are a land of pristine blue skies, valleys of endless grass, and rugged, ancient mountains. At the crossroads of the Silk Road, this obscure region has been criss-crossed by travelers, pilgrims, nomads, and conquering armies. The withdrawal of Tang Chinese troops to the East, and the rise of Islam to the West, and Tibet’s tenuous hegemony over the Himalayas, is a recipe for great conflict and change in this region at the dawn of the medieval age.

In this Immersion Pack, travel to the snow-capped peaks and green valleys of the Pamir Plateau. Develop this most remote region with the help from its rugged clans. Invest in the famed lapis lazuli mines of Sar-i Sang or the gold mines of Gilgit, rebuild the ancient watchtowers of the Pamir Plateau, and celebrate the passing of the seasons with the Chinir Festival. Whether they are Pamiri, Kashmiri, Burusho, or others, choose your allies and foes carefully at this crossroads of the Silk Road as you establish your impenetrable fortress at the Roof of the World.

This will be my last mod release for CK2 before I switch to CK3, ending a pretty fun 8 year period of my life. It started with adding changing the appearance of Cumans and Pechenegs to Mongols, and adding a few new traits; somehow I feel like it's fitting for me to end with the Pamir Mountains, an obscure setting that not too many people will care about, but one important to history and full of wonders nevertheless. Thank you all for your support and encouragement over the years, and hope to see you in CK3!

[B]NOTE: DLCS are not required, as none of the features are lmited by religion. However, if you want to play as Buddhists, Muslims, etc. then you need the appropriate DLCs.[/B]

[h1]What Are Cybrxkhan's Immersion Packs?[/h1]

Cybrxkhan’s Immersion Packs are a collection of small, modular mini-mods designed to add some fun to various, often neglected cultures and regions. These Immersion Packs were loosely inspired by EUIV's, and generally include some flavor events and simple mechanics. While I strive for as much historical authenticity as I can, I will make many compromises as needed to increase flavor and fun.

For those who don’t know me, I was the creator of CPR and VIET, part of the HIP collection of mods, though I no longer work on hat since my retirement a few years ago. Some of stuff here I’ve done for my own personal pleasure over the years after retirement. Consider them a spiritual successor to my VIET Immersion mod, on a smaller scale.

I won’t be making a lot of stuff like I used to; I don’t have time nor energy. Thus, [b]THESE MODS ARE OFFERED AS IS AND I WILL NOT COMBINE THEM INTO ONE MOD[/b]. I am only sharing them now as a resource for modders and for those who want a bit of flavor in their games and/or are old VIETerans who miss the good old days. I’ll only go back or add stuff to these packs when I feel like it or if there are bugs.

Please see the PI forum page for more, or the Steam workshop collection to download all of them.

Please feel free to use my mods in your work, all I ask is that I am credited.
