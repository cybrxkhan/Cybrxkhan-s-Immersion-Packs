silkroad.300.desc;The new year shall soon be upon us and the world of Iran - from the snow-capped Pamir mountains to the fertile plains of Mesopotamia - shall soon be celebrating this holiday which has been observed since ancient times. This year, you intend to make Nowruz a spectacle to be remembered for years. Let us make preparations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.300.a;You begin first by cleaning out your entire residence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.301.tooltip;I have a good feeling about the upcoming new year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.301.desc;Nowruz has officially begun! You wake up in the morning, full of energy and excitement. Before you do anything of importance, however, you first taste honey thrice, and light three candles before speaking to anyone, to ensure good luck and ward off disease.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.301.a;Now that that's taken care of...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.302.tooltip;Time to prepare for the court ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.302.name;The First Day of Nowruz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.302.desc;You welcome Nowruz in a lavishly decorated hall. Your servants have placed silver and gold plates and vases, filled to the brim with fruits and colorful flowers, all throughout, and it looks beautiful.\n\nAs custom has it, you are first greeted by a court Astronomer. He kisses the ground, and congratulates you on the New Year, and wishes you good fortune and prosperity for the coming year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.302.a;Good. Now, let the musicians and singers come in!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.303.tooltip;My court will enjoy the entertainment, certainly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.303.name;The Song and Music of Nowruz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.303.desc;All is festive and joyful as the musicians and singers come in, and your courtiers sit at their assigned locations. As the highest ranking member of the court, you have the right to choose whichever song you want the musicians and singers to perform first. There are many songs traditionally performed during Nowruz, and only Nowruz, after all.\n\nPerhaps you'd like to hear the grand “Nowruz-e bozorg”? Or the softer, more exotic “Nowruz-e Rahawi”? Or maybe the uplifting, spiritual “Bad-e Nowruzi”? Then again there is also the sweet, lovely “Takt-e Piruzi”...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.303.a;Play the majestic Nowruz-e bozorg!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.303.b;I wish to hear the soft sounds of Nowruz-e Rahawi!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.303.c;Inspire me with Bad-e Nowruzi!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

silkroad.304.desc;This year's Nowruz has been nothing short of exciting and fun, but alas, all good things come to an end. The world begins to calm and settle down, and you return to your normal routine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.304.a;May this year be a good one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.305.desc;As part of the Nowruz celebrations, you exchange presents - usually sugar - with your friends and loved ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

silkroad.306.desc;The most popular day of Nowruz is the so-called "Water-pouring Day" for it is a day of happiness and friendship amongst all. You and your household sprinkle rosewater on relatives and guests. You even sprinkle on those who pass by your residence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.306.a;Everyone and everything smells so pleasant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.307.desc;Egg-dying is an important and popular activity during Nowruz. Even you, despite your high rank, decide to partake in this activity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.307.a;What color of paint should I choose first...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.308.desc;You watch as fires are kindled everywhere in the surrounding villages and towns during the Nowruz celebrations. May joy and hope spread everywhere! The fires are meant to symbolize the most amazing acts of creation being re-enacted on a smaller scale.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.308.a;Amazing, yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.308.b;How blasphemous! Muslims shouldn't be doing this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.309.desc;Wine! Nowruz is the perfect time to intoxicate oneself with the finest wines, for is it not a joyous celebration?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.309.a;I drink as much as I need to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.309.b;I shall drink a lot! Let's be merry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.309.c;Muslims shouldn't drink! Do we ignore religion just because we celebrate?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.312.name;Mir-e Nowruzi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.312.desc;Haha! [From.GetTitledFirstName] has been crowned the "Mir-e Nowruzi" or Nowruzian Ruler. As a fake king, he has been given an entire fake throne, officials, and soldiers. Unfortunately, [From.GetTitledFirstName] can now do as he wishes, being the Mir-e Nowruzi. Thankfully his "reign" will only last a few days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.312.a;We'll see how this goes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.313.tooltip;Hopefully I won't be forced to do anything stupid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.314.desc;Dammit! [From.GetTitledFirstName] definitely is enjoying his powers as the Mir-e Nowruzi. He has made me do some very embarrassing things. Things so embarrassing I want to curl up in a ball and die every time I think about them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.314.a;You'll pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.315.desc;[From.GetTitledFirstName]'s reign as the Mir-e Nowruzi has come to an end. Now, everyone has to rid him of the throne, beat him, and force him to flee the building. Won't this be fun?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.315.a;Yes! Quite fun! Violence is quite fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silkroad.315.b;I feel sorry for the poor fellow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
